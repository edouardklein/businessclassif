4600 samples
100 supercategories
~46 samples per supercategory

1 very good strategy for supercategory SC:
- All samples that belong to SC are recognized as such (no false negatives)
- A very small proportion of samples are falsly recognized as belonging to SC (5% False positives)

Running it on the 4600 samples
the 46 positives samples get recognized
5% of 4600 = 23 false positives
Recall = tp/(tp+fn)= 46/(46+0) = 100%
Precision = tp/(tp+fp) = 46/(46+23) = 66% !!!

When faced with a haystack, no matter how good the needle detector is, the precision won't be good !
This happens because the ground truth positive rate is small (~1%)
