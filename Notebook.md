# Business Classification
We want to be able to classify a company into multiple business categories or super-categories by analyzing a textual description  of that company.

# Exp1
The goal of the first experiment was to assess the capabilities of basic textual classification. Please see 

- Supercategories : first two digits
- Categories ending in 9 : misc.
- Cetegory 999 : probably mislabeled
- Category ending in 0 : ambiguous or mislabeld, or in multiple subindustries
